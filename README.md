## Comment on Mariam, our group coordinator. 
### Contributor, [Bayo Opesanya](https://github.com/OpesanyaAdebayo)


* Ini told us about his love for video games, and how it stirred his interest to try to learn how to develop them
	+ P.S: he can play games 24/7, with only sleep in between
* Bayo tried to encourage us to embrace our imaginations
* Razaq talked to us about what he felt makes people fail, and believes that we do because we limit ourselves
* Shelter let us know about the different ways we were harming the environment
	+He suggested that human beings were akin to a virus
* Kachi tallked to us about psychological disorders 

#### Mariam was introduced to us by Chidi at the start of the class. She was introduced as a felllow (D1 i think...)<br/>
Asides the fact that she was gorgeous, I noticed a few things about her I'd like to highlight<br/>
 
* She has a very welcoming personality:
	+ Because she always had a smile on, it was easy to approach her.
* She also has great leadership skills:
 	+ She was able to coordinate very properly and foster team interaction
* She is a very observant person:
 	+ In very litte time, she was able to memorize all our names, identify each person's weaknesses and give helpful advice on how to make improvements. 

#### I wasn't given a lot of time so I can't say much, but I have had an awesome experience at Bootcamp. I believe I can make it through to becoming an Andela fellow, and I'll be forever grateful to Mariam for helping out at bootcamp.
