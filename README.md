#Programming using JavaScript(JS)

   ##About JS

  JavaScript is the **de-facto language of the web**. Algorithms can be implemented in JS, just like any programming language.
  its interpreted, and it uses some sort of weak typing, unlike strong and static typed languages like Java, C++ and C#.
  JavaScript is more like python in some way.

 ##Functions
   Functions are units of code that we give a name, and it does work for us. 

   To define functions using JavaScript: we can use two methods:
       *var myFunc = func(param){}
       *function myFunc(param){}

   A function can return values. or return nothing at all.

   

   Variables
       containers for holding data values

       var is a keyword used to declare variables in JS.
       Syntax:
          var variablename = [value];  //comment: we are declaring a variable and also initializing it at the same time here.
