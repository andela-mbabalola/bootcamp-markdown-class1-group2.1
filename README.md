# Programming using JavaScript(JS)

   ## About JS

  JavaScript is the **de-facto language of the web**. Algorithms can be implemented in JS, just like any programming language.
  its interpreted, and it uses some sort of weak typing, unlike strong and static typed languages like Java, C++ and C#.
  JavaScript is more like python in some way.

 ## Functions
   Functions are units of code that we give a name, and it does work for us. 

   To define functions using JavaScript: we can use two methods:
       * var myFunc = func(param){}
       * function myFunc(param){}

   A function can return values. or return nothing at all.

   

   Variables
       containers for holding data values

       var is a keyword used to declare variables in JS.
       Syntax:
          var variablename = [value];  //comment: we are declaring a variable and also initializing it at the same time here.

## Comment on Mariam, our group coordinator. 
### Contributor, [Bayo Opesanya](https://github.com/OpesanyaAdebayo)

#### Mariam was introduced to us by Chidi at the start of the class. She was introduced as a felllow (D1 i think...)<br/>
Asides the fact that she was gorgeous, I noticed a few things about her I'd like to highlight<br/>
 
* She has a very welcoming personality:
	+ Because she always had a smile on, it was easy to approach her.
* She also has great leadership skills:
 	+ She was able to coordinate very properly and foster team interaction
* She is a very observant person:
 	+ In very litte time, she was able to memorize all our names, identify each person's weaknesses and give helpful advice on how to make improvements. 

 I wasn't given a lot of time so I can't say much, but I have had an awesome experience at Bootcamp. I believe I can make it through to becoming an Andela fellow, and I'll be forever grateful to Mariam for helping out at bootcamp.
